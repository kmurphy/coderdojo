Notes for CoderDojo Tramore (python).

This is a collection of worksheets covering programming in python.

## General Python and <code>turtle</code> Worksheets

This subset of worksheets were based around the <code>turtle</code> module.

 * [01-Guess_my_Number](01-Guess_my_Number/01-Guess_my_Number.pdf)</br>
 Simple guessing game to demo storing data, looping and making decisions. Very little code is given as worksheet was intended to be augmented with one-on-one instruction.

 * [02-Take_Away](02-Take_Away/02-Take_Away/.pdf)</br>
 Simple game that we first implement on the console and later we will develop a graphical version.

 * [03-Graphical_Take_Away](03-Graphical_Take_Away/03-Graphical_Take_Away.pdf)</br>
 Introduction to drawing using the <code>turtle</code> module.

 * [04-Some_More_Turtle_Graphics](04-Some_More_Turtle_Graphics/04-Some_More_Turtle_Graphics.pdf)</br>
 In this worksheet we will build more complicated drawings using <code>turtle</code> module.

 * [05-Doing_Physics_with_Python](05-Doing_Physics_with_Python/05-Doing_Physics_with_Python.pdf)</br>
 This worksheet is a little different. Here we use python to see how objects behave when they are dropped from a height or thrown upwards.

 * [06-Graphical_Take_Away_-_Second_Time_Lucky](06-Graphical_Take_Away_-_Second_Time_Lucky/06-Graphical_Take_Away_-_Second_Time_Lucky.pdf)</br>
 Finally we return to our Take Away game and implement a graphical version using <code>turtle</code> graphics.

 * [07-Monkey_Wars](07-Monkey_Wars/07-Monkey_Wars.pdf)

 OK, we are ready for more complicated games. This time we will build our version of the classic Monkey Wars game.

 * [08-Working_with_Lists](08-Working_with_Lists/08-Working_with_Lists.pdf)</br>
 This worksheet is the first of our worksheets indented to cover various fundamental programming concepts. In this worksheet we will look at lists.

 * [11-Building_a_GUI](11-Building_a_GUI/11-Building_a_GUI.pdf)</br>
 In this worksheet we will develop a simple graphical interface which we can use to control our other python games and programs.

 * [15-Cellular_Automation](15-Cellular_Automation/15-Cellular_Automation.pdf)</bf>
 This worksheet is much more advanced and uses cellular automation to simulate how fires spread in a forest.

 * [16-Christmass_Trees](16-Christmass_Trees/16-Christmass_Trees.pdf)</br>
 We build some animated e-cards using the <code>turtle</code> module.

## <code>pgzero</code>/<code>pygame</code> Worksheets
Written in LaTeX, typeset using luaLaTeX due to extra fonts.
